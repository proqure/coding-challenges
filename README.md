<h1>Phygiworld</h1>

<p>
  Phygiworld is a startup that aims to transform NFC tags into smart tags.<br />
  With Phygiworld, instead of simply opening a static URL, the NFC tags
  dynamically loads a dynamic URL based on the campaign rules saved in the
  database.</p
>

<p>
  Phygiworld users (brands) apply the NFC tags to their physical products, and
  then use the cloud platform to configure the campaign rules of those tags.</p
>

<p>
  Each NFC tag has a unique ID that is made of 8 alpha-numeric characters.<br />
  Each tag belongs to a roll (rolls typically have 100 tags in each).<br />
  Each campaign have 1 or more rolls of tags.</p
>

The entity relationships is as follows.

<p>
  As a developer of Phygiworld you are tasked to implement the core middleware
  function that runs when a user taps on a tag.<br />
  This function receives the tag ID as an input and should return the URL that
  needs to be opened based on what is saved in the campaign rules.<br />
  If multiple URLs are configured in the campaign rules, just return the first
  one.</p
>

<p>
  The rest of the team has already implemented the database functions that you
  can use to query the tags, rolls and campaigns data from the database.<br />
  To know how the data is structured in the database, you can look at the
  diagram below or simply open the JSON files inside the db directory.

<p>
  Please edit the main.js file and implement the <b>getTagURL</b> function.
</p>
You can run the script using
<pre>node main.js</pre>

<br />
There are automated tests at the end of the file, which throw an error if the
functional requirements are not satisfied.
